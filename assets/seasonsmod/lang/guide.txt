season.noSeasonDisplay=This dimension has seasons disabled
	Technically, the Overworld, the Nether, the End, and any mod-added places are the same world.
	If that doesn't carry over well, feel free to use "world" instead of "dimension."
item.seasonwatch.display=Current Season: &season& - Day: &day1& (&day2& days left)
	The "&season&" will be replaced with the current season, as you supplied it above.
	The "&day1&" and "&day2&" will be replaced with their correct values.
	You aren't required to have all three of the special values, but I request that you at least have "&season&".
item.thermometer.display=The thermometer reads &temperature&%
	The "&temperature&" will be replaced with the current temperature.
item.seasonwatch.displayNot=You can't read it, it's spinning very fast!
item.thermometer.displayNot=The thermometer is acting strangely. You can't read it...

	This is for the 'Work in Progress' item.
	It is possible to get the item, but it's not very common, and is almost worthless.
item.WIP=WIP item
item.WIP.info=4
	The number indicates the number of lines used to print the description.
	You can use as many or as few lines as you need, but lines that are too long may continue off the screen.
	There is no automatic text-wrapping, so you get control over all of the linebreaks.

	The first line used is line number "zero", and the last line is one less than the number you used above.
	Add or remove as many lines as you need, but remember to change the number of lines used, above.
item.WIP.info.0=A work in progress item.
item.WIP.info.1=Might as well chuck it...
item.WIP.info.2=Maybe someone else could
item.WIP.info.3=have a use for it?
